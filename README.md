# Rainfall Prediction
In this Python Code, I analyze Austin weather data by employing machine learning techniques for data manipulation, linear regression modeling, and visualization. The initial phase involves importing the data from "austin_weather.csv" into a pandas DataFrame, followed by the removal of redundant columns and the replacement of specific values with 0.0. The cleaned dataset is then saved to "austin_weather_final.csv."
Subsequently, a Linear Regression model is constructed using scikit-learn. Prepares feature variables (X) and a target variable (Y) from the cleaned data, reshapes the target variable, and trains the model. The trained model is employed to visualize the overall precipitation trend over days through a scatter plot. Additionally, individual scatter plots showcase the relationship between precipitation and various weather attributes.
The output includes the saved cleaned dataset and two informative graphs, providing insights into precipitation patterns and their associations with different weather parameters
